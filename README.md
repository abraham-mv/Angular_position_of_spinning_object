# Angular position of spinning_object

A video of a spinner with a white paper square in one of the arms was recorded. The white square represents a particle rotating around and axis. The program creates a mask of this square and prints the pixels that make contrast with the square. If we take time into account it would be like the program is following the moving square on the spinner.
The analysis was made using the OpenCV library for Python.
